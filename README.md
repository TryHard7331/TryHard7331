Hey guys! Today is the 240403 and I'll start my Journey in here..
The first time I heard of github was in my course (which lasted for about 1 year) to become an IT-Technician. 
Since then sometimes I came back in here because I 
needed some source codes from other projects hosted in here.
But until now I was just someone without an account or any other activity in this community.
Now I wannt to document my own projects and progress in IT here so i can have an overview of what I accomplished the last weeks/months.
Also I think it could be beneficial for my next Job (Got my first job in IT one month ago as an IT-Allrounder, but i guess it will not be the last one because
I wanna get into Cybersec. sometime)
I'm between 20-35 years old and pretty new into IT.
Last year I've made an course, (as I said earlier) wich taught me a lot of stuff i didnt knew before. And I love it :)
The only thing I had to do with IT before the course started was watching youtube videos and sometimes playing games.
In the corona time I've lost my job as an production employee. But it was okay for me because I had mental health issues and I didnt really liked the job and night shifts.
Also  in this time I started to get Interessts for hacking and cyber security (through youtube videos) so I decided to make this
IT course, and it was one of my best decision so far i guess. I love my job right now, and never wanna go back to my last one I've had.


    Topics that we covered in the IT-Course were:
    -Hardware (Components of the Computer, assembly, 1st Lvl Support scenarios)
    -Software (Installing some Software, Worked with Office Suit, had to answer some 1st Lvl Support scenarios )
    -Networking (Difference btw. Hub/SW/Router & how they work, TCP/IP & OSI Model, DNS, DHCP, Cisco Packet Tracer projects)
    -Windows Server ( DC, AD )
    -Windows Client
    -Linux Client (Update && Upgrade, Navigating through system, Creating/editing files/dir, MAN pages, just some basic tasks nothing special)
    -SQL (MYSQL & PostgreeSQL CRUID & JOIN commands
    -ITIL 
    -Littlebit programming with a Raspberry Pi (Project) (I readed some pages of automatetheboringstuff to get a tip of understanding programming, 
     and bought an raspberry pi zero > found a repository in here to make this work as an "badusb".

In all these above listed topics we could just cover the Fundamentals I guess, so no deeper knowledge because of lack of time.

    What I did in my free time to reach my goals:
I made an TryHackMe premium account and did there some courses ... comming soon

Created a PicoCTF account and played some beginner level CTFs.. comming soon

    Also I bought a bunch of Books.
    -Linux basics for Hackers (OTW)
    -How Linux works (Brian Ward)
    -The Linux command line (William Shotts)
    -Bug-Bounty Bootcamp (Vickie Li)
    -Gray-Hat Hacking (Harper, et al.)
    But i have to say until now I didnt finished reading anyone of these books.

I know there are definitely a lot of grammatical errors here, (sorry for that) but English is not my 1st Language and
I'll try to improve myself in the upcomming time.

Wish you the best!
Greets TH.
